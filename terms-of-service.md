## Mock Trading Competitions

### Description

Mock Trading Competitions is a feature offered by Roostoo. Roostoo also provides the feature functionality for third party Partner Hosts to conduct mock trading competitions on our app and website. 

Partner Host is a third party that hosts its branded mock trading competitions powered by Roostoo’s mobile app and website platform. The purpose of mock trading competitions is to enable partner hosts to engage their respective community in blockchain and cryptocurrency education. 

The Partner Host has to agree terms with Roostoo in hosting the competitions. Some examples of Partner Hosts are student organizations, educational institutions, and business entities.  

These competitions are in no way sponsored, endorsed or administered by, or associated with, Apple, Inc. and Google, LLC. Any questions, comments or complaints regarding the competitions should be directed to Roostoo and its affiliated Partner Hosts.  


### Eligibility

A.	Roostoo General Competition: 

Each user who signs up an account on Roostoo App or Website is automatically enrolled in Roostoo General Competition as a participant.  

B.	Partner Host Competition: 

Roostoo generates an invitation code to the Partner Host. The specific invitation code is distributed only by the Partner Host to make eligible for their targeted participants to enter the relevant competition. Roostoo will not provide any Partner Host invitation code to other general users. 

To enter: Go to the “competition” tab and click on the relevant Partner Host Competition. Enter the invitation code provided by the Partner Host for the respective competition to be eligible to participate. 

After the completion of each Partner Host Competition, participants can still access to the respective competition through user history. The competition will however be removed from the main page.

It is possible for Partner Hosts to offer prize promotions for their hosted competitions to incentivize participation. In such case, it is the responsibility of the Partner Host to ensure competition framework is legal and compliant to prize promotion laws in jurisdictions where the competition is operated in. Roostoo shall not be liable for any disputes between the participants and the Partner Hosts. 

Roostoo employees, employees of Partner Hosts, and all of their immediate family members and persons living in the same household are not eligible for the Partner Host Competitions.



### Competition Rules

**I. Starting Portfolio**

In default, each participant begins with mock $50000 worth of paper money available in virtual portfolio (Note that it is not real USD, there is NO actual financial transaction in the app).

Participants will be able to start trading according to real-time market prices with the default $50000 paper money. 

**II. Trade Action**
 							          
Participants can enter any number of trades to mock buy and sell cryptocurrencies.  

To mirror real-life cryptocurrency trading, participants can choose between 2 types of trades when buying or selling a cryptocurrency. 

-	Market Order: Refers to executing the trade immediately with the current market price. Each Market Order will charge a virtual commission fee of 0.016%. 
-	Limit Order: Refers to executing the trade at a specified price set by the participant. Each Limit Order will charge a virtual commission fee of 0.012%.	

**III. Leaderboard**
								       
The participants will be ranked according to the overall portfolio return rate during the length of the competition period. 

For example, a participant starts off with $50000 paper money and ends up with $55000 paper money in the portfolio, the portfolio return rate is ($55000 - $50000) / $50000 = 10%.  

Each competition will display internal leaderboard which is updated real-time.

**IV. Competition Duration**

The duration of the Roostoo General Competition is all-time. 

The duration of any Partner Host Competition is decided by the respective Partner Host. Each competition period normally falls within the range of maximum 30 days. 

Roostoo and the Partner Hosts reserve the right to amend the start and end date at any time. 

**V. Winners**

Winners of each Partner Host Competition will be announced separately by the Partner Host. Participant ranking information will also be displayed on the leaderboard page of the Roostoo App.
